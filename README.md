## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome

I am Alex, a computer hobbyist, programming aficionado and *nix enthusiast with
a passion for software architecture and building scalable, reliable systems.

My interests include microservice, API, data structure, automation, AI and
microcontrollers. My main focus is on good code, programming standards, DevOps,
CI/CD, and documentation. I am curious about new technologies, internet standards (RFCs) and specifications.

Currently, I am undergoing training to become a full-stack web developer.

### Projects

On my personal repositories I mainly keep my personal projects, configurations, websites and others things.

For my bigger projects I choose to host them on organization repositories.

- [Hortus](https://github.com/open-hortus)

  A gardenning planner. 

- [Nidus](https://github.com/open-nidus)

  My personal home monitoring and automation solution. 

- [FSWD](https://github.com/open-fswd)

  Full stack web development resources, templates, and projects. Here I put almost everything I do related to development.
