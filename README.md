## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome

I am Alex, a full stack web developer student with a passion for software architecture and building scalable, reliable systems.

My interests include microservice, SOA, API, data structure, automation, microcontrollers, UI, UX, and AI.
My main focus is on good code, programming standards, DevOps, and documentation. I am curious about new technologies, internet standards (RFCs) and specifications.

### Tools

As a developer I am faced with a huge amount of things needed in most of the
development processes so here are some of the tools I use, with some nice icons!

[![Languages and formats](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ts,go,angular,nestjs,react,nodejs,express,mysql,postgres,mongodb,redis,nginx,docker,)](https://skillicons.dev)

As I use many services, tools and frameworks I'm also a minimalist and avid user of bash, vim, markdown, yaml and paper to organize my personal data...

Thank you for visiting my page!
