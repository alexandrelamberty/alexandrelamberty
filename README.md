## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome

I am Alex, a computer hobbyist with a passion for software architecture and building scalable, reliable systems.

My interests include microservice, SOA, API, data structure, automation, microcontrollers, UI, UX, and AI.
My main focus is on good code, programming standards, DevOps,
CI/CD, and documentation. I am curious about new technologies, internet standards (RFCs) and specifications.

Currently, I am undergoing training to become a full-stack web developer.

### Projects

On my personal repositories I mainly keep my utilities projects, configurations, notes, websites and others projects.

For my large, subdivided projects I choose to host them on organization repositories.

Here are some projects I am working on: 

- #### [Hortus](https://github.com/open-hortus)

  A personal gardening planner.

- #### [Nidus](https://github.com/open-nidus)

  Experimental home monitoring and automation solution.

- #### [FSWD](https://github.com/open-fswd)

  Full stack web development resource, templates, and projects. Here I put almost everything I do related to development.

### Tools

As a developer I am faced with a huge amount a things needed in most of the
development processes so here are some of the tools I use, with some nice icons!

[![Languages and formats](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ts,go,angular,nestjs,react,nodejs,express,mysql,postgres,mongodb,redis,nginx,docker,)](https://skillicons.dev)

As I use many services, tools and frameworks I'm also a minimalist and avid user of vim, markdown, yaml and paper to organize my personal data...

Thank you for visiting my page!
