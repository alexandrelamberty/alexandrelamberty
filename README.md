# ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome

I'm Alex, a computer hobbyist, builder, and designer deeply passionate about programming. With a keen interest in software development, I explore various facets of the field, from architectural principles to implementation details. As an avid reader and *nix enthusiast, I'm always seeking new technologies and ways to expand my knowledge base.
