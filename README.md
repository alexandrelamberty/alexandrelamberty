## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome

I am Alex, a computer hobbyist, programming aficionado and *nix enthousiast with
a passion for software architecture and building scalable, reliable systems.

My interests include software architecture, microservices, service-oriented
architecture, APIs (OpenAPI), databases, data structures, automation, AI and
microcontrollers. I am also focused on programming standards, DevOps, CI/CD,
documentation. I am also interested internet standards (RFCs) and
specifications.

Currently I am undergoing training to become a full-stack web developer, and I
am learning TypeScript, Go and Lua as well.

In terms of programming and scripting languages, I have experience with
JavaScript/TypeScript (client/server) and Bash. I have experience working with
databases and storage systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB and
Redis. I am familiar with internet protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, MQTT and
WebSocket. I have also used web hosting and services platforms such as GitHub,
Jira, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, Linode and MongoDB Atlas.

I use Linux as my main operating system and my daily drivers include Xterm, Zsh,
Tmux, Neovim and VSCode. I also have experience with tools such as Git, Docker,
Node.js, npm, ESLint, esbuild, Prettier, Postman and MySQL Workbench.

I have experience working with frameworks such as React, NestJS, Mux, Fiber,
Hugo, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, and TailwindCSS. I am also familiar with other
languages and formats such as HTML, CSS, Markdown, YAML, XML and JSON.

I look forward to sharing my projects, collaborate with others and learning from
the community.

Thank you for visiting my page!
