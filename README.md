## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome

I am Alex, a computer hobbyist, programming aficionado and *nix enthusiast with
a passion for software architecture and building scalable, reliable systems.

My interests include microservice, API, data structure, automation, AI and
microcontrollers. My main focus is on good code, programming standards, DevOps,
CI/CD, and documentation. I am curious about new technologies, internet standards (RFCs) and specifications.

Currently, I am undergoing training to become a full-stack web developer.
