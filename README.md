## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome

I am Alex, a self-taught software developer with a passion for software architecture and building scalable, reliable systems.

My interests include microservice, SOA, API, data structure, automation, microcontrollers, UI, UX, and AI.
My main focus is on good code, programming standards, DevOps, and documentation. I am curious about new technologies, internet standards (RFCs) and specifications.

### Tools

As a developer I am faced with a huge amount of things needed in most of the
development processes, so here are some of the tools I use, with some nice icons!
